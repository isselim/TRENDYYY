## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Ensure edge cases are covered
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## 📝 Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict type checking
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use proper prop types and default values
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing color scheme and spacing
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Recommended VS Code Extensions
- TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- Prettier - Code formatter
- ESLint

### Useful Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Fix ESLint issues automatically
```

## 🐛 Debugging

### Common Issues
- **Build Errors**: Check TypeScript types and imports
